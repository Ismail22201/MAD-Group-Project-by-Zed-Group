Summary:
  Our project is about a Task Management app that allows the user to manage their tasks. It utilizes Flutter, Dart and GetX library for the frontend, and GoLang & REST API for the backend. Our app allows the user to create tasks, view tasks, edit tasks and delete tasks. These tasks are stored on a server and interacted with using a REST API.

Objective:
  The main objectives of our project are:
  1. To allow the user to create, view, edit and delete tasks.
  2. To store these tasks in a server or database and retrieve them when needed by the user.
